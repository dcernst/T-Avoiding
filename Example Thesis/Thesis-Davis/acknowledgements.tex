First and foremost, I would like to express my appreciation and thanks to my advisor Dana C.~Ernst for his dedicated involvement in every step throughout this process. Without his assistance and support, this thesis would have never been accomplished. I would also like to show gratitude to Michael Falk and Janet McShane for taking the time to read my thesis and provide me with useful comments. Most importantly, none of this could have happened without my family. This thesis stands as a testament to your unconditional love and encouragement.
