\section{Star Operations}\label{Star}

The notion of star operations was originally introduced by Kazhdan and Lusztig in~\cite{Kazhdan1979} for simply laced Coxeter systems (i.e., $m(s,t) \leq 3$ for all $s,t \in S$), and was later generalized to all Coxeter systems in~\cite{Lusztig1985}. If $I=\{s,t\}$ is a pair of non-commuting generators of a Coxeter group $W$, then $I$ induces four partially defined maps from $W$ to itself, known as \emph{star operations}. A star operation, when it is defined, increases or decreases the length of an element to which it is applied by 1. For our purposes it is enough to only define the star operations that decrease the length of an element by 1, and as a result we will not develop the notion in full generality.

Let $(W,S)$ be a Coxeter system of type $\Gamma$ and let $I=\{s,t\}\subseteq S$ be a pair of noncommuting generators whose product has order $m$. Let $w \in W(\Gamma)$ such that $s \in \mathcal{L}(w)$. We define $w$ to be \emph{left star reducible by $s$ with respect to $t$} if there exists $t \in \mathcal{L}(sw)$ and $m(s,t) \geq 3$. We analogously define $w$ to be \emph{right star reducible by $s$ with respect to $t$}. Observe that if $m(s,t) \geq 3$, then $w$ is left (respectively, right) star reducible if and only if there is a reduced group element for $w$ such that $w=stu$ (respectively, $w=uts$). We say that $w$ is \emph{star reducible} if it is either left or right star reducible.

\begin{example}\label{ex:starred}
Let $w \in W(B_4)$ and let $\overline{w}=s_0s_1s_0s_2s_3$ be a reduced expression for $w$. We see that $w$ is left star reducible by $s_0$ with respect to $s_1$ to $s_1s_0s_2s_3$, since $m(s_0,s_1)=4$ and $s_0 \in \mathcal{L}(w)$ while $s_1 \in \mathcal{L}(s_0w)$. Also $w$ is right star reducible by $s_3$ with respect to $s_2$ to $s_0s_1s_0s_2$, since $m(s_2,s_3)=3$ and $s_3 \in \mathcal{R}(w)$ and $s_2 \in \mathcal{R}(ws_3)$.
\end{example}

It may be helpful to visualize star reductions in terms of heaps. Figure~\ref{fig:heapy} represents $H(\overline{w})$. Note that we can see $s_0$ is in the left descent set of $w$ since $s_0$ is in the bottom row of the heap. Furthermore, multiplying on the left by $s_0$ we get the heap in Figure~\ref{fig:multiplied}. Again, since $s_1$ is in the bottom row of the heap, $s_1 \in \mathcal{L}(s_1w)$. In Figure~\ref{fig:heapy} we also see that $s_3$ is in the right descent set of $w$ since $s_3 \in \mathcal{R}(w)$. Multiplying on the left by $s_3$ we can see that $s_2$ would be in the top level of the heap so $s_2 \in \mathcal{R}(ws_3)$. From this we can interpret visually an element $w \in W(\Gamma)$ is left star reducible (respectively, right star reducible) if there exists a heap that we can pull a block off the bottom row of the heap (respectively, top of the heap) and a new block that wasn't previously in the bottom row (respectively, top row) is now in the bottom row (respectively, top row) of the heap. That is, we can systematically dismantle the heap for a given element by pulling blocks off of the bottom row (respectively, top row) of the heap and have the heap decrease in height, meaning there are fewer rows of the heap than there were in the original, or a block that was previously trapped in the second (respectively, second to last) row of the heap is now free to be in either the first or second (respectively, second to last or last) row. If the heap has the same number of rows as the original and if now blocks that were in the second or second to last row of the heap can now be in the first or last row of the heap when we attempt pulling a single block off the top and a single block off the bottom and we try all possible combination of single blocks in the top row and bottom row, then the heap is not star reducible.

Using the notion of star reduction we are now able to introduce the concept of a star reducible Coxeter group. We say that a Coxeter group $W(\Gamma)$, or it's Coxeter graph $\Gamma$, is \emph{star reducible} if every element of $\FC(\Gamma)$ is star reducible to a product of commuting generators. That is, $W(\Gamma)$ is star reducible if when we apply star operations repeatedly to $w \in \FC(\Gamma)$, eventually we obtain a product of commuting generators. Using heaps to visualize a star reducible Coxeter group given a heap in $\FC(\Gamma)$, we are able to pull the top or bottom most block off of the heap and have the heap decrease in height (the number of rows that it consists of). We can perform this pulling of blocks off the top and bottom of the heap systematically until the heap consists of one row, corresponding to an element that is a product of commuting generators. For example in Figure~\ref{fig:heapy}, we were able to apply a star reduction to remove the bottommost block corresponding to the generator $s_0$ and obtain the new heap seen in Figure~\ref{fig:multiplied}. We see that the heap in Figure~\ref{fig:multiplied} has one less row than Figure~\ref{fig:heapy}. We could do the same with the block on top of Figure~\ref{fig:multiplied} corresponding to $s_3$ and have the heap again decrease in the number of rows it has. Performing one more star reduction in pulling the brick off the bottom of Figure~\ref{fig:multiplied} which corresponds to $s_1$ in the word would leave us with a heap that is only 1 row which is a product of commuting generators. Thus Figure~\ref{fig:heapy} can be star reduced to a product of commuting generators.  In~\cite{Green2006a}, Green classified all star reducible Coxeter groups. 
%The Coxeter groups $W(A_n)$, $W(B_n)$ and $W(\widetilde{C}_n)$ are star reducible. However, $W(A_n)$ and $W(B_n)$ don't have non-trivial T-avoiding elements, while $W(\widetilde{C}_n)$ in one parity does have non-trivial T-avoiding elements.
\begin{theorem}[Green,~\cite{Green2006a}]
	Let $W(\Gamma)$ be a Coxeter group with (finite) generating set $S$. Then $W(\Gamma)$ is star reducible if an only if each component of $\Gamma$ is either a complete graph with labels $m(s,t)\geq 3$, or is one of the following types: type $A_n$ $(n \geq 1)$, type $B_n$ $(n \geq 2)$, type $D_n$ $(n \geq 4)$, type $F_n$ $(n \geq 4)$, type $H_n$ $(n \geq 2)$, type $I_2(m)$ $(m \geq 3)$, type $\widetilde{A}_{n-1}$ $(n \geq 3 \textrm{ and } n \textrm{ odd })$, type $\widetilde{C}_{n-1}$ $(n\geq 4 \textrm{ and } n \textrm{ even })$, type $\widetilde{E}_6$ or type $\widetilde{F}_5$. \qed
\end{theorem}  

\section{Non-Cancellable Elements}
 
We now introduce the concept of weak star reducible, which is related to the notion of cancellable in~\cite{Fan1997}. Let $(W,S)$ be a Coxeter system of type $\Gamma$ and let $I=\{s,t\} \subseteq S$ be a pair of noncommuting generators of the Coxeter group $W(\Gamma)$. If $w  \in \FC(\Gamma)$, then $w$ is \emph{left weak star reducible by $s$ with respect to $t$ to $sw$} if
\begin{enumerate}
\item $w$ is left star reducible by $s$ with respect to $t$ and;
\item $tw \notin \FC(W)$.	
\end{enumerate}
Notice that (2) implies that $l(tw)>l(w)$. Also note that we are restricting out definition of weak star reducible to the set of $\FC$ elements of $W(\Gamma)$. We analogously define \emph{right weak star reducible by $s$ with respect to $t$ to $ws$}. We say that $w$ is \emph{weak star reducible} if $w$ is either left or right weak star reducible. Otherwise, we say that $w$ is \emph{non-cancellable} or \emph{weak star irreducible}.

\begin{example}\label{ex:noncancel}
Let $w \in \FC(B_4)$ and let $\overline{w}=s_0s_1s_0s_2s_3$ be a reduced expression for $w$ as in Example~\ref{ex:starred}. By Example~\ref{ex:starred} we know that $w$ is left star reducible. Also, $tw=s_1s_0s_1s_0s_2s_3$ which is not in $\FC(B_4)$. Thus, we see that $w$ is left weak star reducible by $s_0$ with respect to $s_1$ to $s_1s_0s_2s_3$. In addition, Example~\ref{ex:starred} showed that $w$ is right star reducible. But, $wt=s_0s_1s_0s_2s_3s_2$ which is not in $\FC(B_4)$. Thus, $w$ is right weak star reducible by $s_3$ with respect to $s_2$ to $s_0s_1s_0s_2$. This implies that $w$ is not non-cancellable.
\end{example}

Again it might be useful to visualize the concept of weak star reducible in terms of heaps. Recall in Figure~\ref{fig:heapy} we have a representation for $w$ as described in Example~\ref{ex:noncancel}. In Section~\ref{Star}, we described the systematic dismantling of the heap that could occur with star reductions being repeatedly applied to the heap in Figure~\ref{fig:heapy}. In Figure~\ref{fig:noncancel} we can see that when we multiply $w$ by $s_1$ on the right we end up with a braid, which is  highlighted in orange. Since the heap in Figure~\ref{fig:noncancel} has the impermissible subheap seen in Figure~\ref{fig:C&B2}, $s_1w \notin \FC(B_4)$.  When using heaps to identify whether an element $w$ of $\FC(\Gamma)$ is noncancellable or not there are two key properties that must be observed. The first of the properties is that the $H(w)$ must be able to be dismantled from the top or bottom so that the heap resulting from pulling the top block off or the bottom block off is one row shorter or allows for a new brick to be in the top most or bottom most row of the heap. The second property that must be observed is that given the block that appears in the top or bottom of the heap when the star operation is performed, adding another of that block to the top or bottom of the original heap respectively will result in an impermissible subheap appearing. If both of these properties occur, then the element that corresponds to the heap is noncancellable.

\begin{example}
Let $w \in \FC(B_4)$ and let $\overline{w}=s_0s_1$ be a reduced expression for $w$. Note that $w$ is left (respectively, right) star reducible by $s_0$ with respect to $s_1$ (respectively, by $s_1$ with respect to $s_0$). However, $s_1s_0s_1 \in \FC(B_4)$ (respectively, $s_0s_1s_0 \in \FC(B_4)$). Thus $w$ is non-cancellable.
