\section{T-Avoiding Elements in Types $\widetilde{A}_n$ and $A_n$}
We start by classifying the T-avoiding elements in Coxeter groups of type $\widetilde{A}_n$ and $A_n$. We first classify non-trivial T-avoiding elements in $W(\widetilde{A}_n)$.

\begin{theorem}
 If $n \geq 2$ and $n$ is even, then there are no non-trivial T-avoiding elements in $W(\widetilde{A}_n)$. Otherwise, if $n \geq 2$ and $n$ is even then $W(\widetilde{A}_n)$ contains non-trivial T-avoiding elements.
\begin{proof}
	This is~\cite[Proposition~3.1.2.]{Fan1999}.
\end{proof}
\end{theorem}

%Now we will classify the non-trivial T-avoiding elements in $W(A_n)$. Recall that $W(A_n)$ is a star reducible Coxeter group which by our observations above implies that if $W(A_n)$ has non-trivial T-Avoiding elements, these elements will be not FC. In~\cite{Fan1999}, the non-trivial T-avoiding elements were classified. The classification is seen in the following theorem.

%We will now proceed into the classification of T-avoiding elements in $W(\widetilde{A}_n)$. Similar to $W(A_n)$, $W(\widetilde{A}_n)$ will also have trivial T-avoiding elements since $W(\widetilde{A}_n)$ contains elements that are products of commuting generators. We will now proceed to classifying non-trivial T-avoiding elements in $W(\widetilde{A_n})$. The following classification is a result from~\cite{Fan1999}.

The previous theorem implies that when $n$ is even the Coxeter group of type $\widetilde{A}_n$, has no non-trivial T-avoiding elements. However, while $n$ is odd, the Coxeter group of type $\widetilde{A}_n$ has non-trivial T-avoiding elements. The classification seen in~\cite{Fan1999} did not specifically classify the non-trivial T-avoiding elements for type $\widetilde{A}_n$ for $n$ odd. Since $W(\widetilde{A}_n)$ for $n$ odd is not star reducible we know that the non-trivial T-avoiding elements could be FC. The following is our conjecture regarding what the non-trivial T-avoiding elements are in $W(\widetilde{A}_n)$ for $n$ odd.
\begin{conjecture}
	The only non-trivial T-avoiding elements in $W(\widetilde{A}_n)$ for $n$ odd are of the form $w=(s_0s_2 \cdots s_{n-2}s_ns_1s_3 \cdots s_{n-3}s_{n-1})^k$  for $k \in \mathbb{Z}^+$. 
\end{conjecture} 

Notice that the above non-trivial T-avoiding elements are FC. As stated in the conjecture we believe that these are the only non-trivial T-avoiding elements. However, this remains an open problem. We now proceed with the classification of T-avoiding elements in Coxeter groups of type $A_n$. 

\begin{corollary}
Then there are no non-trivially T-avoiding elements in $W(A_n)$. 
\begin{proof}
Since $W(A_n)$ is a parabolic subgroup of $W(\widetilde{A}_n)$ this is a consequence of~\cite[Proposition 3.1.2.]{Fan1999}. Specifically, we can obtain the Coxeter graph of type $A_n$ from the Coxeter graph of type $\widetilde{A}_n$ for $n$ even by removing the appropriate number of vertices and edges. From this we can see that if $W(A_n)$ was to have non-trivial T-avoiding elements, this would imply that $W(\widetilde{A}_n)$ for $n$ even would also have non-trivial T-avoiding elements as well. Thus $W(A_n)$ can not have bad elements.
\end{proof}
\end{corollary}

\section{T-Avoiding Elements in Type $D_n$}

In this section we will classify the non-trivial T-avoiding elements in the Coxeter group of type $D_n$. Recall that $W(D_n)$ is a star reducible Coxeter group and as a result of this any non-trivial T-avoiding element are not FC.

\begin{theorem}
 The only non-trivial T-avoiding elements in $W(D_n)$ for $n \geq 4$ are given by the heaps \textcolor{red}{Once we figure out the heap include it here.}.
\begin{proof}
	This is a consequence of~\cite[Section 2.2]{Gern2013a}. For the full details regarding his classification see~\cite{Gern2013a}. Note that in his classification, Gern  refers to non-trivially T-avoiding elements as ``bad."
\end{proof}
\end{theorem}

\section{T-Avoiding Elements in Type $F_n$}

In this section we classify what is known regarding the non-trivial T-avoiding elements in the Coxeter groups of type $F_n$ for $n \geq 4$. Note that all of the following results are unpublished. %Recall that $W(F_n)$ is a star reducible Coxeter group so any non-trivial T-avoiding element in $W(F_n)$ will not be FC.

We start with the Coxeter group of type $F_5$.  Recall that $W(F_5)$ is a star reducible Coxeter group so any non-trivial T-avoiding elements will not be FC. Before we begin the classification we introduce the notion of a specific element in $W(F_5)$.  We call this element a single \emph{bowtie}, which is seen in Figure~\ref{fig:singbowtie}. Note that in this heap, the \textcolor{orange}{orange} blocks correspond to the elements that have bond strength 4 (Figure~\ref{fig:singbowtie4}). Note that the element is also not FC and we have highlighted the braid in \textcolor{teal}{teal} which is seen in Figure~\ref{fig:singbowtiebraid}. In stacking the single bowties together, we get a ``stack of bowties." This is done by removing the top most layer of the heap and adding a new single bowtie to the stack, a stack of bowties is seen in Figure~\ref{fig:stackobowties}. These heaps are referenced in the following theorem which classifies all non-trivial T-avoiding elements in the following in the Coxeter group of type $F_5$ completed by Cross, Ernst, Hills-Kimball, and Quaranta in 2012.

\begin{theorem}
The only non-trivial T-avoiding elements in $W(F_5)$ are stacks of bowties. \qed	
\end{theorem}


As a result of the classification in type $F_5$, Cross et al. were also able to classify the non-trivial T-avoiding elements in $W(F_4)$. 

\begin{corollary}
There are no non-trivial T-avoiding elements in $F_4$. \qed	
\end{corollary}

As a result of their work, Cross et al. conjectured that in Coxeter groups of type $F_n$ for $n \geq 5$, an element is non-trivially T-avoiding if and only if it is a stack of bowties multiplied by a product of commuting generators. In 2013, Gilbertson and Ernst worked with this conjecture and quickly found out that it was incorrect. The heap seen in Figure~\ref{fig:f6bat} corresponds to a non-trivial T-avoiding element in $F_6$. It turns out that like the bowties discussed above these elements can also be stacked to create an infinite number of non-trivial T-avoiding elements. In addition, as $n$ gets large there are a number of things that can be altered that result in additional non-trivially T-avoiding elements. From this we conjecture that the classification of T-avoiding elements in Coxeter systems of type $F_n$ for $n \geq 6$ gets complicated very quickly. Classifying T-avoiding elements in $W(F_n)$ for $n \geq 6$ remains an open problem.

\section{T-Avoiding Elements in Type $I_2(m)$}

We next will classify the T-avoiding elements in Coxeter groups of type $I_2(m)$. Note that in Coxeter groups of type $I_2(m)$, the only products of commuting generators have length 1. Although the following is a quick result, we believe that it does not already appear in the literature.
\begin{theorem}
The Coxeter group $W(I_2(m))$ has no non-trivial T-avoiding elements.
\begin{proof}
	The graph for the Coxeter group of type $I_2(m)$ appears in Figure~\ref{fig:I}. Note that the graph consists of two vertices, namely, $s_1$ and $s_2$, and a single edge with weight $m$. Also, recall that $W(I_2(m))$ is a star reducible Coxeter group. This implies that any non-trivial T-avoiding elements in $W(I_2(m))$ must not be FC, ss all of the FC elements have Property T. The only non-FC element in $W(I_2(m))$ is the element of length $m$ which has exactly two reduced expressions consisting of alternating products of $s_1$ and $s_2$. Cleary, this element begins and ends with a product of noncommuting generators. Thus, this element has Property T. Hence $W(I_2(m))$ has no non-trivial T-avoiding elements. 
\end{proof}	
\end{theorem}
