	An interesting type of element of a Coxeter group is star reducible element. An element that is star reducible has a reduced product, $w=stu$ or $w=uts$ where $s$ and $t$ do not commute. An element that has this property is also said to have Property T. An element that does not have Property T, is said to be T-avoiding. It has been shown that some Coxeter groups have T-avoiding elements and others do not. A natural question that arises from this is \emph{which Coxeter groups have T-avoiding elements and which do not}. 
	
	In this thesis we state the already known results regarding T-avoiding elements in certain Coxeter groups. We also present a proof regarding the T-avoiding elements in Coxeter systems of types $B_n$ and $\C_n$.

%A star reducible Coxeter group is one in which every fully commutative element can be reduced to a product of commuting generators through repeated star reductions. A complete list of these star re
