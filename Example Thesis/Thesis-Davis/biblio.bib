abstract = {A class of associative algebras ("cellular") is defined by means of multiplicative properties of a basis. They are shown to have cell representations whose structure depends on certain invariant bilinear forms. One thus obtains a general description of their irreducible representations and block theory as well as criteria for semisimplicity. These concepts are used to discuss the Brauer centraliser algebras, whose irreducibles are described in full generality, the Ariki-Koike algebras, which include the Hecke algebras of type A and B and (a generalisation of) the Temperley-Lieb and Jones, recently defined "annular" algebras. In particular the latter are shown to be non-semisimple when the defining parameter (3 satisfies yq(n)(- ) - 1> where yn is the rt-th Tchebychev polynomial and g(n) is a quadratic polynomial},

abstract = {Unilateral below-knee amputees develop abnormal gait characteristics that include bilateral asymmetries and an elevated metabolic cost relative to non-amputees. In addition, long-term prosthesis use has been linked to an increased prevalence of joint pain and osteoarthritis in the intact leg knee. To improve amputee mobility, prosthetic feet that utilize elastic energy storage and return (ESAR) have been designed, which perform important biomechanical functions such as providing body support and forward propulsion. However, the prescription of appropriate design characteristics (e.g., stiffness) is not well-defined since its influence on foot function and important in vivo biomechanical quantities such as metabolic cost and joint loading remain unclear. The design of feet that improve these quantities could provide considerable advancements in amputee care. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to couple design optimization with dynamic simulations of amputee walking to identify the optimal foot stiffness that minimizes metabolic cost and intact knee joint loading. A musculoskeletal model and distributed stiffness ESAR prosthetic foot model were developed to generate muscle-actuated forward dynamics simulations of amputee walking. Dynamic optimization was used to solve for the optimal muscle excitation patterns and foot stiffness profile that produced simulations that tracked experimental amputee walking data while minimizing metabolic cost and intact leg internal knee contact forces. Muscle and foot function were evaluated by calculating their contributions to the important walking subtasks of body support, forward propulsion and leg swing. The analyses showed that altering a nominal prosthetic foot stiffness distribution by stiffening the toe and mid-foot while making the ankle and heel less stiff improved ESAR foot performance by offloading the intact knee during early to mid-stance of the intact leg and reducing metabolic cost. The optimal design also provided moderate braking and body support during the first half of residual leg stance, while increasing the prosthesis contributions to forward propulsion and body support during the second half of residual leg stance. Future work will be directed at experimentally validating these results, which have important implications for future designs of prosthetic feet that could significantly improve amputee care.},

While Coxeter groups have already been exposited from algebraic and geometric perspectives, this book will be presenting the combinatorial aspects of Coxeter groups. The authors have included an exposition of Coxeter groups along with a rich variety of exercises, ranging from easy to very difficult, giving the book the unique character of serving as both a textbook and a monograph.},

@article{Al-Harthy2003,
abstract = {The aim of this study was to investigate the use of cement kiln dust (CKD) as a cementitious material in concrete and mortar. CKD was added to concrete and mortar mixtures to study its effect on the strength and on the ability of the cover zone to absorb water, an important factor in the deterioration process. Experimental results on compressive strengths, flexural strength and toughness of concrete samples containing CKD are reported. The sorptivity and the initial surface absorption tests (ISAT) of mortars were used to measure the absorption characteristics for different mortar samples containing CKD. It was found that substitution of cement with CKD does not lead to strength gain for all samples studied and proper addition of CKD has no negative effects on strength properties. It is also shown that mortars prepared using suitable amounts of CKD have better absorption characteristics. However, above certain limits, the water absorption of the mortar increased with increasing CKD contents and decreasing mortar strengths. © 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {The Kazhdan-Lusztig polynomials for finite Weyl groups arise in the geometry of Schubert varieties and representation theory. It was proved very soon after their introduction that they have nonnegative integer coefficients, but no completely combinatorial interpretation for them is known in general. Deodhar (1990) has given a framework for computing the Kazhdan-Lusztig polynomials, which generally involves recursion. We define embedded factor pattern avoidance for general Coxeter groups and use it to characterize when Deodhar's algorithm yields a simple combinatorial formula for the Kazhdan-Lusztig polynomials of finite Weyl groups. Equivalently, if (W, S) is a Coxeter system for a finite Weyl group, we classify the elements w in W for which the Kazhdan-Lusztig basis element C'w can be written as a monomial of C's where s in S. This work generalizes results of Billey-Warrington (2001) which identified the Deodhar elements in type A as 321-hexagon-avoiding permutations, and Fan-Green (1997) which identified the fully-tight Coxeter groups.},
