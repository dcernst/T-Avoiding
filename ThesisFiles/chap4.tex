\section{Star Operations}\label{sec:star}

The notion of a star operation was originally introduced by Kazhdan and Lusztig in~\cite{Kazhdan1979} for simply-laced Coxeter systems (i.e., $m(s,t) \leq 3$ for all $s,t \in S$), and was later generalized to all Coxeter systems in~\cite{Lusztig1985}. If $I=\{s,t\}$ is a pair of non-commuting generators of a Coxeter group $W$, then $I$ induces four partially defined maps from $W$ to itself, known as \emph{star operations}. A star operation, when it is defined, increases or decreases the length of an element to which it is applied by 1. For our purposes it is enough to only define the star operations that decrease the length of an element by 1, and as a result we will not develop the notion in full generality.

Let $(W,S)$ be a Coxeter system of type $\Gamma$ and let $I=\{s,t\}\subseteq S$ be a pair of generators with $m(s,t) \geq 3$. Let $w \in W(\Gamma)$ such that $s \in \mathcal{L}(w)$. We define $w$ to be \emph{left star reducible by $s$ with respect to $t$} if there exists $t \in \mathcal{L}(sw)$. We analogously define $w$ to be \emph{right star reducible by $s$ with respect to $t$}. Observe that $w$ is left (respectively, right) star reducible if and only if $w=stu$ (respectively, $w=uts$), where the product on the right hand side of the equation is reduced and $m(s,t) \geq 3$. We say that $w$ is \emph{star reducible} if it is either left or right star reducible.

\begin{example}\label{ex:starred}
Let $\w=s_0s_1s_0s_2$ be a reduced expression for $w \in W(B_4)$. We see that $w$ is left star reducible by $s_0$ with respect to $s_1$ to $s_1s_0s_2$ since $m(s_0,s_1)=4$ and $s_0 \in \mathcal{L}(w)$ while $s_1 \in \mathcal{L}(s_0w)$. Also, $w$ is not right star reducible since $s_1$ is not in $\RD(w)$ when $w$ is multiplied on the right by either $s_0$ or $s_2$. 
\end{example}

It may be helpful to visualize star reductions in terms of heaps. Let $(W,S)$ be a Coxeter system of type $\Gamma$ and let $I=\{s,t\}\subseteq S$ be a pair of generators with $m(s,t) \geq 3$. Suppose $w$ is left star reducible by $s$ with respect to $t$. Then there exists a heap for $w$ where the block for $s$ is fully exposed to the top. Removing the block for $s$ off of the top allows for $t$ to now be fully exposed to the top. Similarly if $w$ is right star reducible by $s$ with respect to $t$, then there exists a heap for $w$ where the block for $s$ is fully exposed to the bottom. Removing the block for $s$ off of the bottom allows for $t$ to now be fully exposed to the bottom. This implies that if a heap for $w \in W(\Gamma)$ has this property, then $w$ is star reducible. The following example illustrates the above concept.

\begin{example}\label{ex:starredheap}
Let $\w=s_0s_1s_0s_2s_3$ be a reduced expression for $w \in W(B_4)$. Note that $w$ if FC. By Example~\ref{ex:starred} we know that $w$ is left star reducible by $s_0$ with respect to $s_1$. In Figure~\ref{fig:heapy}, we see the heap for $w$. Notice that the block for $s_0$ is fully exposed to the top of the heap. Removing the block for $s_0$ gives the heap in Figure~\ref{fig:multiplied}. Notice that the block for $s_1$ is now fully exposed to the top of the heap. However, notice that the block for $s_0$ and $s_2$ are fully exposed to the bottom. In removing either of these we are unable to fully expose $s_1$ to the bottom. Thus we can see that $w$ is not right star reducible. If $w$ was not FC then we would not be able to say that $w$ is not right star reducible as there could be a different heap for $w$ in which we were able to fully expose an element that was previously blocked. 
\end{example}


%It may be helpful to visualize star reductions in terms of heaps. Figure~\ref{fig:heapy} represents $H(\w)$. Note that we can see $s_0$ is in the left descent set of $w$ since $s_0$ is in the top row of the heap. Furthermore, multiplying on the left by $s_0$ we get the heap in Figure~\ref{fig:multiplied}. Again, since $s_1$ is in the top row of the heap, $s_1 \in \mathcal{L}(s_1w)$. In Figure~\ref{fig:heapy} we also see that $s_3$ is in the right descent set of $w$ since $s_3$ is in the bottom row of the heap. Multiplying on the left by $s_3$ we can see that $s_2$ would be in the bottom level of the heap so $s_2 \in \mathcal{R}(ws_3)$. From this we can interpret visually an element $w \in W(\Gamma)$ is right star reducible (respectively, left star reducible) if there exists a heap that we can pull a block off the bottom row of the heap (respectively, top of the heap) and a new block that wasn't previously in the bottom row (respectively, top row) is now in the bottom row (respectively, top row) of the heap. That is, we can systematically dismantle the heap for a given element by pulling blocks off of the bottom row (respectively, top row) of the heap and have the heap decrease in height, meaning there are fewer rows of the heap than there were in the original, or a block that was previously trapped in the second (respectively, second to last) row of the heap is now free to be in either the first or second (respectively, second to last or last) row. If the heap has the same number of rows as the original and if now blocks that were in the second or second to last row of the heap can now be in the first or last row of the heap when we attempt pulling a single block off the top and a single block off the bottom and we try all possible combination of single blocks in the top row and bottom row, then the heap is not star reducible.

Using the notion of star reduction we are now able to introduce the concept of a star reducible Coxeter group. We say that a Coxeter group $W(\Gamma)$, or it's Coxeter graph $\Gamma$, is \emph{star reducible} if every element of $\FC(\Gamma)$ is star reducible to a product of commuting generators. That is, $W(\Gamma)$ is star reducible if when we apply star reductions repeatedly to $w \in \FC(\Gamma)$, eventually we obtain a product of commuting generators. Using heaps to visualize a star reducible Coxeter group given a heap in $\FC(\Gamma)$, we are able to systematically remove a fully exposed block from the top or bottom of the heap and have a block that was previously not fully exposed become fully exposed until we are left with a heap that is one row in height. 

In~\cite{Green2006a}, Green classified all star reducible Coxeter groups.

%we are able to pull the top or bottom most block off of the heap and have the heap decrease in height (the number of rows that it consists of) or have a new block come into the top or bottom most rows. We can perform this pulling of blocks off the top and bottom of the heap systematically until the heap consists of one row, corresponding to an element that is a product of commuting generators. For example in Figure~\ref{fig:heapy}, we were able to apply a star reduction to remove the topmost block corresponding to the generator $s_0$ and obtain the new heap seen in Figure~\ref{fig:multiplied}. We see that the heap in Figure~\ref{fig:multiplied} has one less row than Figure~\ref{fig:heapy}. We could do the same with the block on bottom of Figure~\ref{fig:multiplied} corresponding to $s_3$ and have the heap again decrease in the number of rows it has. Performing one more star reduction in pulling the brick off the top of Figure~\ref{fig:multiplied} which corresponds to $s_1$ in the reduced expression would leave us with a heap that is only 1 row which is a product of commuting generators. Thus Figure~\ref{fig:heapy} can be star reduced to a product of commuting generators.  In~\cite{Green2006a}, Green classified all star reducible Coxeter groups. 
%The Coxeter groups $W(A_n)$, $W(B_n)$ and $W(\widetilde{C}_n)$ are star reducible. However, $W(A_n)$ and $W(B_n)$ don't have non-trivial T-avoiding elements, while $W(\widetilde{C}_n)$ in one parity does have non-trivial T-avoiding elements.
\begin{theorem}[Green,~\cite{Green2006a}]
	Let $(W,S)$ be a Coxeter system of type $\Gamma$. Then $(W,S)$ is star reducible if an only if each component of $\Gamma$ is either a complete graph with labels $m(s,t)\geq 3$, or is one of the following types: type $A_n$ $(n \geq 1)$, type $B_n$ $(n \geq 2)$, type $D_n$ $(n \geq 4)$, type $F_n$ $(n \geq 4)$, type $H_n$ $(n \geq 2)$, type $I_2(m)$ $(m \geq 3)$, type $\widetilde{A}_{n-1}$ $(n \geq 3 \textrm{ and } n \textrm{ odd })$, type $\widetilde{C}_{n-1}$ $(n\geq 4 \textrm{ and } n \textrm{ even })$, type $\widetilde{E}_6$, or type $\widetilde{F}_5$. \qed
\end{theorem}  

In~\cite{Green2007}, Green defined star reducible Coxeter groups to have \emph{Property F}. We go a bit farther and say that an element of $FC(\Gamma)$ that is star reducible to a product of commuting generators has Property F. In the same paper, Green defined a Coxeter group with \emph{Property S} to be a Coxeter group in which each element $w \in W(\Gamma)\backslash \FC(\Gamma)$ is star reducible to an element $w$ for which either $\LD(w)$ or $\RD(w)$ contains a pair of noncommuting generators. Again we extend the definition to a specific element in the $W(\Gamma)$. That is, $w \in W(\Gamma)\backslash \FC(\Gamma)$ has Property S if $w$ is star reducible to a product of non-commuting generators in $\mathcal{L}(w)$ or $\mathcal{R}(w)$.

\section{Non-Cancellable Elements}
 
We now introduce the concept of weak star reducible, which is related to the notion of cancellable in~\cite{Fan1997}. Let $(W,S)$ be a Coxeter system of type $\Gamma$ and let $I=\{s,t\} \subseteq S$ be a pair of noncommuting generators. If $w  \in \FC(\Gamma)$, then $w$ is \emph{left weak star reducible by $s$ with respect to $t$ to $sw$} if
\begin{enumerate}
\item $w$ is left star reducible by $s$ with respect to $t$, and
\item $tw \notin \FC(W)$.	
\end{enumerate}
Notice that condition (2) implies that $l(tw)>l(w)$. Also note that we are restricting out definition of weak star reducible to the set of $\FC$ elements of $W(\Gamma)$. We analogously define \emph{right weak star reducible by $s$ with respect to $t$ to $ws$}. We say that $w$ is \emph{weak star reducible} if $w$ is either left or right weak star reducible. Otherwise, we say that $w$ is \emph{non-cancellable} or \emph{weak star irreducible}. Notice that from this we know that weak star reducible implies star reducible. However, star reducible does not imply weak star reducible.

\begin{example}\label{ex:noncancel}
 Let $\w=s_0s_1s_0s_2$ be a reduced expression for $w \in W(B_4)$ as in Example~\ref{ex:starred}. From Example~\ref{ex:starred} we know that $w$ is left star reducible. However, $tw=s_1s_0s_1s_0s_2$ which is not in $\FC(B_4)$. Thus, we see that $w$ is left weak star reducible by $s_0$ with respect to $s_1$ to $s_1s_0s_2$. In addition, Example~\ref{ex:starred} showed that $w$ is not right star reducible and hence $w$ is not right weak star reducible. However, since $w$ is left weak star reducible we know that $w$ is not non-cancellable.
\end{example}

Again it might be useful to visualize the concept of weak star reducible in terms of heaps. Recall that in Section~\ref{sec:star} we described what a star reduction looks like in a heap and what a star reducible heap looks like. Since the definition of weak star reducible includes that a heap is star reducible we again need to have those properties. In addition, for a heap to be weak star reducible when adding the block that becomes fully exposed when a block is removed from the heap must create a braid in  the heap forcing the new heap to not be FC. That is, one of the impermissible configurations seen in Section~\ref{sec:Heaps} will appear.

\begin{example}
	Let $\w=s_0s_1s_0s_2$ be a reduce expression for $w \in W(B_4)$ as in Example~\ref{ex:noncancel}. From Example~\ref{ex:noncancel}, we know that $w$ is left weak star reducible. Recall in Figure~\ref{fig:starred} the heap for $w$ was seen along with what it star reduced to. In Figure~\ref{fig:noncancel} we see that adding $s_1$ to the top of the heap creates a braid which is highlighted in \textcolor{orange}{orange}.
\end{example}
  

%Recall in Figure~\ref{fig:heapy} we have a representation for $w$ as described in Example~\ref{ex:noncancel}. In Section~\ref{sec:star}, we described how  In Figure~\ref{fig:noncancel} we can see that when we multiply $w$ by $s_1$ on the right we end up with a braid, which is  highlighted in orange. Since the heap in Figure~\ref{fig:noncancel} has the impermissible subheap seen in Figure~\ref{fig:C&B2}, $s_1w \notin \FC(B_4)$.  When using heaps to identify whether an element $w$ of $\FC(\Gamma)$ is Non-Cancellable or not there are two key properties that must be observed. The first of the properties is that the $H(w)$ must be able to be dismantled from the top or bottom so that the heap resulting from pulling the top block off or the bottom block off is one row shorter or allows for a new brick to be in the top most or bottom most row of the heap. The second property that must be observed is that given the block that appears in the top or bottom of the heap when the star operation is performed, adding another of that block to the top or bottom of the original heap respectively will result in an impermissible subheap appearing. If both of these properties occur, then the element that corresponds to the heap is not Non-Cancellable.

\end{figure*}

\begin{example}
Let $w \in \FC(B_4)$ and let $\w=s_0s_1$ be a reduced expression for $w$. Note that $w$ is left (respectively, right) star reducible by $s_0$ with respect to $s_1$ (respectively, by $s_1$ with respect to $s_0$). However, $s_1s_0s_1 \in \FC(B_4)$ (respectively, $s_0s_1s_0 \in \FC(B_4)$). Thus $w$ is non-cancellable. Visually the heap appears in Figure~\ref{fig:noncancelvisual}. Clearly when $s_0$ is added to the bottom of the heap, the new heap is still in $\FC(B_4)$ and the same can be said when $s_1$ is added to the top of the heap.
